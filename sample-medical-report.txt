MEDICAL CONSULTATION REPORT

Patient: John Doe
Age: 45 years
Gender: Male
Date: 2024-08-17
Physician: Dr. Sarah Smith, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Patient presents with chest discomfort and shortness of breath during physical activity, lasting for the past 2 weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Doe reports experiencing substernal chest pressure, rated 6/10 in intensity, occurring primarily during moderate exercise such as climbing stairs or walking uphill. The discomfort resolves with rest within 2-3 minutes. He also notes mild dyspnea on exertion that has progressively worsened over the past month.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago)
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 3 years ago)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Family history of coronary artery disease (father had MI at age 52)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Metformin 1000mg twice daily
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Aspirin 81mg daily

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 145/92 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18/min, O2 sat 97% on room air
General: Alert, oriented, mild diaphoresis
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 S2 present, no murmurs
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Extremities: No peripheral edema

LABORATORY RESULTS:
- Fasting Glucose: 156 mg/dL (elevated)
- HbA1c: 8.2% (elevated)
- Total Cholesterol: 220 mg/dL
- LDL: 145 mg/dL (elevated)
- HDL: 38 mg/dL (low)
- Triglycerides: 185 mg/dL (elevated)

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS:
ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, no acute ST changes
Chest X-ray: Heart size normal, lungs clear

ASSESSMENT:
1. Chest pain, likely anginal equivalent - rule out coronary artery disease
2. Diabetes mellitus type 2, poorly controlled
3. Hypertension, not at goal
4. Dyslipidemia with elevated cardiovascular risk

PLAN:
1. Cardiology referral for stress testing and further cardiac evaluation
2. Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily
3. Add Metoprolol 25mg twice daily for cardiac protection
4. Intensify diabetes management - consider insulin therapy
5. Lifestyle counseling: diet modification, exercise program, smoking cessation
6. Follow-up in 2 weeks
7. Patient educated on cardiac symptoms and when to seek emergency care

RISK FACTORS:
- Age and gender (45-year-old male)
- Diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled)
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Family history of premature CAD
- Sedentary lifestyle

This case represents a high-risk patient requiring immediate cardiovascular evaluation and aggressive risk factor modification.
